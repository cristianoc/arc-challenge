### MicroARC

This directory contains the implementation of **MicroARC**, a variant of the ARC framework focused on finding the simplest grid transformations. MicroARC tasks involve applying minimal sequences of transformations (like flips, rotations, and inversions) to map input grids to output grids.

- **`microARC.py`**: Python script implementing the MicroARC theory, identifying the simplest, well-defined transformation for given grid tasks.
