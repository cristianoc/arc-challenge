# BigARC: The Largest and Most Colorful Puzzles

**BigARC** is a new variant of the ARC challenge that focuses on the largest puzzles with the greatest number of colors. This challenge aims to push the boundaries of current ARC-solving techniques by introducing more complex and colorful grids.

## BigARC Tasks

BigARC tasks consist of grids with a large number of cells and a wide variety of colors. The goal is to identify and apply transformations that can handle the increased complexity and color diversity.

## Solution Approach

The solution approach for BigARC is still under development. It will likely involve advanced techniques for handling large grids and multiple colors, building on the methods used in other ARC challenges.

### Example

This is an example of a BigARC task, with a 23x23 grid and 10 colors:
