### MiniARC

This directory contains resources for **MiniARC**, a variant of the ARC framework where the challenge is to solve grid transformation puzzles using sequences of operations like flips, rotations, and inversions.

- **`grid_xform_puzzle.py`**: Python script that generates an image visualizing all possible transformations of a grid, organized by complexity level. Each line in the image corresponds to a different level of transformation sequences, starting with the simplest (identity) at the top.
  
- **`grid_xform_puzzle.md`**: Documentation describing the grid transformation puzzle, the theory behind MiniARC, and example puzzles with solutions.

- **`cat_image.png`**: A sample image used as input for the grid transformation puzzles in `grid_xform_puzzle.py`.
