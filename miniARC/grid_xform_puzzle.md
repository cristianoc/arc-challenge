### MiniARC: Grid Transformation Puzzle Report

#### Problem Overview

In **MiniARC**, you are tasked with working on an $n \times n$ grid, where each cell is either black (represented by 0) or white (represented by 1). The goal is to apply a sequence of transformations to this grid, simplify these sequences, and solve puzzles based on provided examples.

#### Transformations

The grid in **MiniARC** can undergo the following transformations:

1. **Rotations**:
   - **R1**: 90 degrees
   - **R2**: 180 degrees
   - **R3**: 270 degrees

2. **Symmetric Transformations**:
   - **X**: Horizontal flip
   - **Y**: Vertical flip

3. **Inversion**:
   - **I**: Swapping 1 with 0 (black with white and vice versa)

These transformations can be combined into sequences. Certain commutation laws in **MiniARC** allow rearranging these sequences without changing the final outcome:

- **Inversion (I)** can be moved before or after any other transformation.
- A **Symmetric transformation followed by a Rotation** can be reordered, possibly changing the type of symmetric transformation.

#### Normal Form

By applying these commutation laws in **MiniARC**, any sequence of transformations can be reduced to a **normal form**â€”the simplest possible sequence that cannot be further simplified. The normal form follows this order:

1. **Rotations**
2. **Horizontal flip (X)**
3. **Vertical flip (Y)**
4. **Inversion (I)**

Each step is optional, depending on the specific transformation sequence. The **length** of the normal form in **MiniARC** is defined by the number of transformations involved, ranging from zero (no transformation, the identity) to four.

#### Counting Normal Forms

In **MiniARC**, there are 32 possible normal forms, categorized by their length:

- **Length 0**: 1 form (the identity transformation)
- **Length 1**: 6 forms
- **Length 2**: 12 forms
- **Length 3**: 10 forms
- **Length 4**: 3 forms

#### Visualization

To better understand these transformations, a visualization can be created by applying all 32 normal forms to a non-symmetric, black-and-white image in **MiniARC**. The results are displayed in rows, organized by the length of the transformation sequence. This visualization is generated using the `grid_xform_puzzle.py` script.

#### The Puzzle Game

The **MiniARC** game revolves around solving puzzles using transformation sequences:

1. **Examples**: Each example consists of an input-output grid pair that excludes certain transformations.
2. **Tests**: The challenge is to identify the correct transformation sequence based on the given examples.

##### Game Objective

The objective in **MiniARC** is to find the **simplest transformation** that explains all the provided examples. The process is as follows:

1. Begin with the grid image showing all 32 transformations.
2. For each example, eliminate the transformations that the example excludes.
3. After processing all examples, review the remaining transformations.
4. Identify the **lowest level** (i.e., shortest sequence) that still has uncrossed transformations.
5. If only one transformation remains at this level, it is the simplest and correct solution.
6. If more than one transformation remains, the problem is ambiguous, indicating multiple possible solutions.

This approach systematically narrows down the possible transformations to identify the simplest valid one.

**Simplest solution** in **MiniARC**: Horizontal flip $`X`$ followed by Inversion $`I`$.

**Wrong solution** in **MiniARC**: 180 rotation $`R2`$, followed by vertical flip $`Y`$, followed by Inversion $`I`$.

#### Puzzle 4: Ambiguity Detection

**1 Example (Input -> Expected Output):**

- **Input:**
  ```
  [[1 0 0]
   [0 1 0]
   [0 0 1]]
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  [[0 0 1]
   [0 1 0]
   [1 0 0]]
  ```

**Result:**  
**Ambiguity detected:** Multiple transformations remain at level 1.

**Ambiguous Transformations at Level 1:**
- **R1**: Rotate 90 degrees
- **R3**: Rotate 270 degrees
- **X**: Horizontal flip
- **Y**: Vertical flip

This puzzle illustrates a case where the problem statement is ambiguous, as multiple valid transformations could produce the same output. Additional constraints or examples are necessary to uniquely identify the simplest solution.
