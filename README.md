## Part 1: The General DSL

### Types and Methods

```python
class Grid:
    def Rotate(self, direction: Direction) -> Grid
    def Flip(self, axis: Axis) -> Grid
    def Translate(self, dx: Direction, dy: Direction) -> Grid
    def ColorChange(self, from_color: str, to_color: str) -> Grid
    def Copy(self) -> Grid  # Method to create a copy of the grid

type Direction = Clockwise | CounterClockwise | Left | Right | Up | Down
type Axis = Horizontal | Vertical
```

## Part 2: Simple Examples

#### Example 1: Rotation and Color Change
```python
grid: Grid(shape) = Grid(shape)
rotated_grid: Grid(shape) = grid.Rotate(Clockwise)
final_grid: Grid(shape) = rotated_grid.ColorChange("red", "blue")
```

#### Example 2: Translation and Flip
```python
grid: Grid(shape) = Grid(shape)
translated_grid: Grid(shape) = grid.Translate(Left, Up)
final_grid: Grid(shape) = translated_grid.Flip(Horizontal)
```

## Part 3: Advanced Example

### Creating a 6x6 Grid from a 2x2 Grid

**Input Grid (2x2)**:
```python
input_grid: Grid(2, 2) = Grid(2, 2)
```

**Transformation Steps**:
```python
# Create copies of the input grid
first_grid: Grid(2, 2) = input_grid.Copy()
second_grid: Grid(2, 2) = input_grid.Flip(Horizontal)
third_grid: Grid(2, 2) = input_grid.Copy()

# Combine rows
first_row: List[Grid(2, 2)] = [first_grid, first_grid, first_grid]
second_row: List[Grid(2, 2)] = [second_grid, second_grid, second_grid]
third_row: List[Grid(2, 2)] = [third_grid, third_grid, third_grid]

# Combine rows into a single grid
output_grid: Grid(6, 6) = Grid.CombineRows([first_row, second_row, third_row])
```

### Explanation
- **Initial Grid**: `input_grid` is the starting point.
- **Methods**: Applied transformations like `Copy`, `Flip`, and `CombineRows`.
- **Intermediate Grids**: States after each transformation.
- **Final Grid**: `output_grid` is the 6x6 grid containing the transformed grids.
- **Shape Annotations**: Explicitly mentioned for clarity.
- **Colors**: Named for readability.

This DSL provides a structured and type-safe way to describe and perform grid transformations, facilitating collaboration and ensuring correctness in operations.
