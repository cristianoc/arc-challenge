# InPaintingARC: A Vertical Subset of ARC-AGI

**InPaintingARC** is a variant of the ARC challenge intended to be smaller in variety, but not simpler on a per-puzzle basis, than full ARC-AGI.

## Solution Approach

The approach to InPaintingARC requires a re-thinking of the way solutions are represented and explored. Solutions consist of spatial specifications that are composable and make use of predicates capturing certain aspects of the priors required (objects, color, symmetry, frames). To drive the search for solutions, a special form of bi-abductive inference is developed, where given a set of examples and one input, one derives the spec for the transformation that the examples represent, and the corresponding final output.

### Key Components

1. **Spatial Specifications**: These are composable elements that define the spatial relationships and transformations required to solve the puzzle.
2. **Predicates**: These capture specific aspects of the priors required, such as objects, color, symmetry, and frames.
3. **Bi-Abductive Inference**: This is a special form of inference used to derive the transformation specifications from a set of examples and one input.

### Detailed Methodology

1. **Detection of Features**:
   - **Color Features**: Detecting and using color patterns to identify and transform objects.
   - **Shape Features**: Using shape information to match and transform objects.
   - **Symmetry Features**: Leveraging symmetry to identify and transform objects.

2. **Transformation Rules**:
   - **Primitive Transformations**: Basic transformations such as translation, rotation, and reflection.
   - **Composite Transformations**: Combining multiple primitive transformations to achieve more complex results.

3. **Matching and Solving**:
   - **Object Matching**: Identifying and matching objects between input and output grids.
   - **Grid Transformations**: Applying the derived transformations to solve the puzzle.

### Example Workflow

1. **Input and Output Grids**: Given a set of input and output grids, the system detects the relevant features and identifies the necessary transformations.
2. **Transformation Specification**: Using bi-abductive inference, the system derives the transformation specifications.
3. **Application of Transformations**: The derived transformations are applied to the input grid to generate the output grid.

### Challenges and Future Work

- **Scalability**: Ensuring the approach scales to more complex puzzles.
- **Generalization**: Improving the ability to generalize across different types of puzzles.
- **Optimization**: Enhancing the efficiency of the bi-abductive inference process.

## Conclusion

InPaintingARC represents a focused yet challenging subset of the ARC problem, requiring innovative approaches to feature detection, transformation specification, and inference. The methodologies developed here contribute to the broader goal of solving the ARC challenge and advancing the field of artificial general intelligence.
